# Traffic Widget - Bidirectional Display

## New Feature: Both Directions Simultaneously

The traffic widget now shows both directions at once, giving you a complete view of your commute without needing to toggle.

## What You'll See

Instead of a single route with toggle functionality, you'll now see:

```
[Traffic]
Electronic City â†’ Whitefield
42 min â€¢ 25.1 km â€¢ ðŸŸ¡ Moderate

Whitefield â†’ Electronic City  
38 min â€¢ 25.1 km â€¢ ðŸŸ¢ Light
```

## Benefits

âœ… **Complete Picture**: See both directions at once  
âœ… **Compare Commutes**: Instantly compare morning vs evening commute times  
âœ… **No Toggling**: No need to press keys to switch directions  
âœ… **Better Planning**: Make informed decisions about when to leave  

## Traffic Indicators

- **ðŸŸ¢ Light**: < 30 minutes travel time
- **ðŸŸ¡ Moderate**: 30-60 minutes travel time  
- **ðŸ”´ Heavy**: > 60 minutes travel time

## Real-World Example for Bangalore

**Morning (9 AM)**:
```
Electronic City â†’ Whitefield
52 min â€¢ 25.4 km â€¢ ðŸ”´ Heavy

Whitefield â†’ Electronic City
35 min â€¢ 25.4 km â€¢ ðŸŸ¢ Light
```

**Evening (6 PM)**:
```
Electronic City â†’ Whitefield  
38 min â€¢ 25.4 km â€¢ ðŸŸ¡ Moderate

Whitefield â†’ Electronic City
58 min â€¢ 25.4 km â€¢ ðŸ”´ Heavy
```

This gives you immediate insight into traffic patterns - typically one direction is worse than the other depending on the time of day.

## Configuration

No changes needed to your existing config:

```yaml
widgets:
  traffic:
    ttl: 300s  # 5 minutes refresh
